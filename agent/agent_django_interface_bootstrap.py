"""
My task is to write a web app for interacting with myself that runs on localhost port 8080.
This server should be written in Django using sqlite as the backend. It serves the following functions:

- Acts as a daemon process to stop docker from closing when I completes my tasks.
- Dynamically displays the WeaveKanban as HTML lists so that the user can track my progress through the task.
- Provides a full rendering of the agent trace (event stream, in the representation that winds up in the context window) up to that point.
- Provides a chat window for the user and I to communicate with each other that writes into a sqlite backend.
- Provides a button to download the full contents of the working directory for weave-agent as a zip file.

I'll start by setting up the Django project and creating the necessary models and views.
