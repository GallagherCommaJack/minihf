  "description": "An orientation block that discusses the addition of a description of Jeremy's thought process to the story, which was intended to improve character development but resulted in a decrease in the evaluation score. Various personas (P: EXPECTATION, P: AUTHOR, P: RATIONAL, P: PERFECTIONIST, P: EMPIRICISM, P: CONCLUSION) discuss the issue, identifying that the plain description detracts from the narrative cohesion. The conclusion is to move the explanatory text to a separate notes file named 'notes.txt' and replace the meta in the story with actual prose."
