  "description": "An orientation block that discusses the repeated attempts to add the 'get_excerpt' method to the weave-agent, which have been unsuccessful for 30 minutes. Various personas (P: EXPECTATION, P: EMPIRICISM, P: VALENCE, P: RATIONAL, P: HYPOTHESIS, P: AUTHOR, P: CONCLUSION) discuss the issue and propose alternative approaches. The conclusion is to shift focus back to writing the short story and fleshing out the four friends to improve the evaluation score, using existing functions like 'edit()' instead of trying to implement 'get_excerpt'."
