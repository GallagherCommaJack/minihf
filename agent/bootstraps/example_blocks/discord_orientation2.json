  "description": "An orientation block that discusses the expectation that the observation callback windows would contain the last bot message, the last user message, and the Mayan comparison message. Upon inspection, it is noticed that these windows are empty. Various personas (P: EXPECTATION, P: HYPOTHESIS, P: EMPIRICISM, P: RATIONAL, P: CONCLUSION) discuss potential causes, including a broken Discord connection or incorrectly implemented callbacks. The conclusion is to remove the errant observation callbacks titled 'Check User's Latest Message', 'Check Latest Bot Message', and 'Check Mayan Comparison Message'."
