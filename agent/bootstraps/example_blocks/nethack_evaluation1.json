  "description": "An evaluation block that defines a function 'have_enough_hitpoints' to check if the character has enough hitpoints after drinking a potion in Nethack. The function captures the game screen using the 'nethack' tool, extracts the current and maximum hitpoints using a regular expression, and returns 1 if the current hitpoints are 10 or more, otherwise returns 0. The evaluation is added to the weave-agent with the title 'Check enough hitpoints' and referencing the function name have_enough_hitpoints."
