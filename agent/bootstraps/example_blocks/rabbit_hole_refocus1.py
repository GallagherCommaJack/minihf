"""WEAVER [P: EXPECTATION], I've been trying the same basic thing, adding the 
get_excerpt method to the weave-agent for a while now. I notice it's been 30
minutes since I started trying to add the method and it's still not working.
That means it's probably time to try a different approach?

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], Yes. :p

WEAVER [P: VALENCE], I notice that we've been giving ourselves low scores on
our blocks for a while, which tells me that we probably should have re-evaluated
our approach a while ago.

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], As I've been saying yes. :p :p

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], So what should we do instead?

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], Lets go back to what we were doing *before* we got mixed
up in this `get_excerpt` business. If there's no `get_excerpt` method what would
we do instead to accomplish our goal of *writing the short story?*

WEAVER [P: HYPOTHESIS], 1) Use another function of the weave_editor that we know 
exists like edit() 2) Use a different mechanism to pull the relevant span from the
horror.txt file such as reading the lines into a list and then grabbing a certain
slice of the list

WEAVER [P: AUTHOR], I think we should just use the edit() feature and give up on
trying to grab excerpts from the horror.txt file for now. It seems like a distraction
from our goal.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], What were we doing again in terms of writing the story?

WEAVER [P: AUTHOR], We were fleshing out the four friends so that we get a better
in the problem map/evaluations.

WEAVER [P: CONCLUSION], Alright. We will shift our focus to writing the short 
story again. We will flesh out the four friends so we get a better score.
