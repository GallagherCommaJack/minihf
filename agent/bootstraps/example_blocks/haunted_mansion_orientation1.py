"""WEAVER [P: EXPECTATION], I added a description of Jeremy's thought process to
the story in the hopes that q4, whether the story develops the four friends as 
characters, would go up. However I observe that it has gone down by 0.2. We need
to figure out why this is occurring and take actions to flesh out the characters
in a way that satisfies the weave evaluator.

WEAVER [P: AUTHOR], Well the first thing I notice is that we put in a fairly
plain description of Jeremy's inner monologue. This detracts from the narrative
cohesion of the story, kind of like if we injected our notes into the text rather
than write the text those notes are supposed to describe.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], We could make a separate notes file to keep our worldbuilding
separate from the actual story text.

WEAVER [P: PERFECTIONIST], What should we name the notes file?

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], Uh, notes.txt?

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], Yeah that. 

WEAVER [P: CONCLUSION], We'll take the text that's currently in the story explaining
Jeremy's mental state and put it in the notes.txt file, while replacing the meta
in the story with actual prose.
