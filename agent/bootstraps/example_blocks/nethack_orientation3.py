"""WEAVER [P: EXPECTATION], The purpose of the action I took was to leave the room. 
I sent the keys "jjjh" to try and reach the stairs ( > ) and now seem to be on
a different floor. 

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], So what now?

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], We should leave this room by going northwest, as indicated
by the open + that's edge aligned with the walls |, which indicates a opening in
this room we can leave and explore through.

WEAVER [P: MOTOR], That means we send "l" + ("j" * 9).

WEAVER [P: CONCLUSION], I will send "l" + ("j" * 9) to exit the room."""
