"""
The current observation callback window includes a callback for fetching messages from the Discord client.
Since the observation is expected to verify whether the bot has successfully responded to the user message,
the existing observation callback is appropriate and does not need to be reviewed or changed.
Additionally, no new observation callbacks seem necessary for this action.
