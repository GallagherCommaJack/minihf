"""WEAVER [P: EXPECTATION], In the previous tick we wrote down an expectation 
that the user would send us a message if we wait. This expectation was validated
because I can see in the WeaveDiscordClient that a user has replied to us. The
user said 'Hello.', which leaves it ambiguous how we should reply. Ideas?

WEAVER [P: CAUTIOUS], We could just wait for them to send another message and 
clarify their intent. That has a low risk for us.

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], Nah, if you look at the timestamp it's already been a few
minutes since they sent that. If they were going to send us a follow up they'd have
already done it.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], We could ask them something sort of cliche and low entropy
like "How are you?". That would put the ball in their court.

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], I think I'd prefer the direct approach. We ask them what
they want from us, if anything. That would move the conversation forward faster.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], Well, since we're in a chat assistant(?) type setup they
presumably do want something from us but they also probably expect a certain
measure of politeness. So maybe more like "How can I help you today?" than
"What do you want?", since the latter can be read as hostile if the user has
the wrong prior on what tone that sentence would be associated with.

WEAVER [P: ARBITER], Sounds good to me, lets do that.

WEAVER [P: CONCLUSION], We will use the WeaveDiscordClient to send the message
"How can I help you today?" to the user. I will keep the action simple and just
send the message, since I've already identified that the user has sent a message
and what I should say in response."""
