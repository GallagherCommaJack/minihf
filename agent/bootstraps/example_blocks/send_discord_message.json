 "description":"A simple action callback named 'respond' that sends a discord message. It retrieves the discord client tool from the self.tools dictionary and gets the discord client instance associated with discord-bot-1325039818673094739. It then uses the client.send_message ( client send message ) method of the discord client tool to send the message 'Hello!'. Finally self.add_action ( self dot add action ) is used to add the action callback to the weave-agent with the title 'Respond to the user' and referencing the function name respond"
