 "description":"An action callback named 'send_multiplication_result' that performs a multiplication operation and sends the result as a discord message. It retrieves the discord client tool from the self.tools dictionary and gets the discord client instance associated with discord-bot-1325039818673094739. It then performs the multiplication of 9378 by 1009 using a Python arithmetic statement. The result is sent as a message using the client.send_message method of the discord client tool. Finally self.add_action is used to add the action callback to the weave-agent with the title 'Send multiplication result' and referencing the function name send_multiplication_result"
