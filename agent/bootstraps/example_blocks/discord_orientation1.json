  "description": "An orientation block that discusses the expectation that the user would send a message, which was validated. The user replied with 'Hello.', leaving the response ambiguous. Various personas (P: EXPECTATION, P: CAUTIOUS, P: EMPIRICISM, P: RATIONAL, P: ARBITER, P: CONCLUSION) discuss different approaches to respond. The conclusion is to use the WeaveDiscordClient to send the message 'How can I help you today?' to the user, keeping the action simple and direct."
