"""WEAVER [P: EXPECTATION], My expectation was that the action would get me past
the introductory screen and I would begin the game. The game has in fact started.
Now we need to figure out what to do.

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], We could walk around and get a sense of the floor we're on.
After all the game is procedurally generated so it's different for each run.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], I say we check our inventory, since what items you spawn with
is randomized between playthroughs and what you start out with tells you a lot
about what your options are in combat, getting past obstacles, etc.

WEAVER [P: JUDGE], Checking our inventory doesn't seem like a terrible idea, since
it's a free action and provides us an advantage.

WEAVER [P: EMPIRICISM], I don't have a strong objection or anything but I do feel
obligated to point out it's not a *free* action. We still have a six hour time
limit to finish the game (is it even possible to finish Nethack in six hours?)
so getting in the habit of playing slowly because checking our inventory and such
is "free" means we won't finish the game in time.

WEAVER [P: RATIONAL], This is true but I still think we should check our inventory
since the game just started and sometimes you spawn with something overpowered like
a wand of death, and we would probably like to know if we have that.

WEAVER [P: CONCLUSION], Yeah let's check our inventory."""
